        "Real education must ultimately be limited to men who insist on knowing, the rest is mere sheep-herding." - Ezra Pound

        "There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance." - Socrates

        For those who want to learn, Open Source functions as a platform for educators and students that value the merits of independent inquiry.
  <br/><br/>
        Craft a course on subjects of your expertise, and exercise control over your schedule, compensation, and syllabus. At Open Source, we believe in the importance of free speech and self-determination. The current climate that pervades higher education is hostile to diversity of thought, and Open Source hopes to counter the normalization of ideological echo chambers.
  <br/><br/>
        We encourage educators and students to pursue their interests, but also challenge themselves to study that which they are inclined to disagree with in order to better develop a critical, informed view of the world.
  <br/><br/>
        Open Source is emboldened by an intellectual community of honesty, rigor, and difference. We're excited to continue growing, and are excited to welcome all who want to engage.
  <br/><br/>
        Happy learning!
